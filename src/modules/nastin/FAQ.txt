1. Pressure residual converges but not the algebraic residual of the continuity equation?
   - Check convergence of continuity solver.
   - Check how critical time step is computed: at element center or at Gauss points?
     May need to use Gauss points

2. Algebraic residual of continuity equation does not converge:
   - If converged pressure is zero, it could be as
     ||b-Ax||/||b|| with ||b|| -> 0 does not make sense
